# iOSDailyDemo

This repository is a collection of various iOS demo projects, code snippets, and experiments created for learning and testing purposes.

## Overview

The `sources` directory contains a large number of individual Xcode projects, each demonstrating a specific feature, framework, or concept in iOS development. These projects cover a wide range of topics and serve as a practical reference for different iOS APIs.

## Topics Covered

The projects in this repository explore many aspects of the iOS SDK, including but not limited to:

*   **SwiftUI:** Custom views, data flow (`@State`, `@Binding`, `@EnvironmentObject`), animations, and layout.
*   **ARKit:** Augmented Reality demos using SceneKit and RealityKit.
*   **Combine:** Reactive programming with publishers, subscribers, and operators.
*   **Core Bluetooth:** Interacting with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.
*   **WidgetKit:** Creating home screen widgets.
*   **Data Handling:** Codable, JSON manipulation, and data persistence with `AppStorage`.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** `async/await`, `AsyncStream`, and `AsyncPublisher`.
*   **UIKit Integration:** Hosting SwiftUI views in UIKit and vice-versa.
*   **And many more...**

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Browse the `sources` directory to find a topic of interest.
3.  Open the corresponding `.xcodeproj` or `.swiftpm` file in Xcode to build and run the demo.

Feel free to explore the different projects to see how various iOS features are implemented.
